# x86_64 Assembly & C Project
====================================

This is a mixed-language project demonstrating C code calling x86_64 assembly
routines. It manages low-level I/O and provides fundamental math services.

The main logic is implemented in C, utilizing assembly helpers for specific
tasks like system calls and direct hardware manipulation where necessary.

Building the project is done via 'make', and the resulting executable can be
run directly. Cleanup is handled by 'make clean'.
