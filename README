x86_64

===============================================

This repo demonstrates systems programming on x86_64 Linux.
It combines C for logic and I/O with assembly for low-level kernel interaction
and performance-critical operations.

The codebase includes math utilities, string manipulation, and direct syscall
interfaces. All modules follow x86_64 calling conventions and ABI standards,
showing how modern systems software integrates compiled and assembled code.
since it is just only beginning it doesn't contain huge codebase.
It is only a **initail** structure...

Building "make" Running "./program" [use this commands].

Cleaning "make clean" [to clean build artifacts].

"The build system automatically *compiles* all C sources and *assembles* all
architecture-specific code, *linking* them into a *single* executable."

------------

Architecture

The project is organized into *distinct* modules. Math functions are provided in
both C and hand-optimized assembly. String utilities operate on kernel buffers.
All assembly code uses position-independent addressing and proper stack frames.

This serves as a reference implementation for systems-level programming on
x86_64, demonstrating register usage, calling conventions, and direct kernel
communication through syscalls [Like all project maintained].
